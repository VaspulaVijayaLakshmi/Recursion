# Recursion-Practice

Combination Sum problem


// unique combinations when elements are repeating

// [2,5,2,1,2]

// sort - [1,2,2,2,5]

// [1,2,5]
// [1,2,5]
// we need to use [1 2 5] - only once.

// In permutations - (1,1,2) ,(1,2,1),(2,,1,1) are treated as different and counted
// where as in combinations all these are considered same.

so skip duplicates
