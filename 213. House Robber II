//INTUITION

//the first thing that comes to mind is oddsum and even sum
//but that doesn't yield max amount
//eg:[10,1,2,15]

//even sum = [10,2] = 12
//odd sum  = [1,15] = 16

// but if we choose [10,15] = 25 //maximum we can rob

//so the condition in the ques is we can't rob 2 adjacent houses
//but its not necessarily mean we have to rob two alternate houses
//whatever we choose shouldn't be adjancent that's that.
